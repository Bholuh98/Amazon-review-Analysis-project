My first project Assignment from my Data Analysis Class with Incubator Hub.

I have learnt so many things from Ms Excel and now to my portfolio building.

## Project Topic : E-Commerce  Analysis

### Project Overview 
This Data analysis projects aims to generate insights to Amazon product and customer review data. This will guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

Ms Excel  was used for
-  Data Cleaning
  1. Data Manipulation
  2. Data munching 
-  Data Analysis
-  Data Presentation
### Data cleaning and preparation
In the intial phase of data cleaning and preparations, I performed the following actions
- Data inspection

### Exploratory data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about data such as :
- What is the average discount percentage by product category?
- How many products are listed under each category?
- What is the total number of reviews per category?
- Which products have the highest average ratings?
- What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
- Which products have the highest number of reviews?
-  How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
-  What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 
4.0, etc.)?
-  what is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
-  What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, 
₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
- How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
- How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
- Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
- Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
### Data Analysis



### Results/findings 
## The results of the Analysis showed that :
- Palmora Group  has more male in kaduna , Abuja and Lagos.
- They also have more male in production, legal, support, sales , training , accounting and marketing department  while human resources , Services, business development, engineering, research and development  department have more female.
- Female were paid $31.81m while male were paid 34.74m. This implies that there is a gender gap  in the company
- Kaduna has the highest gender pay gap 
- production, legal , support, human resources , sales and accounting department underpay their female  staffs compared to male staffs while business development , services, engineering,  marketing , research and development under pay their male staffs compared to the female staffs .
- The minimum salary payment for palmoria company is $28,130. This means that the company does not meet up with the minimum requirement of $90,000 pay structure.
- Most of the employees earn $50,000 and above. While only few earn within $20,000-30,000
- Kaduna staffs earn better followed by Abuja and Lagos.

  ### Recommendations 
- Conduct a thorough role-by-role salary benchmarking to identify unjustified differences by gender.
- Establish a company-wide minimum salary benchmark of at least $90,000 to meet up with the new regulations 
- Set diversity hiring goals for male-dominated departments (Production, Legal, Sales) and regions
- Adjust compensation where women are underpaid for equivalent roles.
- Implement a standardized pay band system across all regions.
